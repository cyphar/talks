## talks ##

In order for people to be able to re-use and improve talks that I've presented,
as well as to serve as a reference for people who want to go through my slides
again, this repository contains the full source code for all of my
presentations.

All of my presentations can be edited, viewed and compiled using entirely free
software suites for such tasks.
